**Milestone 6 - Final Submission: Deadline by end of Week 12 [15th December]**
Week-12 is completely focused on the project, and no new course content is released this week. We will schedule a Software Engineering Project Showcase, where each group will present their project to instructors, other groups, and even other students in the BS program. The presentation will be graded and will be part of the final submission. More details about what the presentation should contain will be notified later.
Other components of the final submission are as follows:

UI screens for each API endpoint  - In the project, we do not expect you to build the entire application. However, we require you to design the UI screens for each API endpoint. This can be done in HTML,CSS, JS. You can use ready-made templates as well, as long as you cite the source.
Final project report (consistent with intermediate milestone documents).
Detailed report on work done from Milestone 1 through Milestone 5.
A section describing code review, issue reporting and tracking using screenshots.
Components evaluated in final Project Evaluation:

The overall design of the project.
Teamwork that includes code review, issue reporting and tracking etc.
Efficient coding practices.
Consistent design through different milestones.
